The integration pipeline and hyperparameters were selected based on various runs optimizing the integration across species. The version we show here had the best performance considering an optimal balance of:

- mixing of species for each cluster or cell type (if applicable - some cell types were underrepresented in some of the species. A signal that we also wanted to preserve)
- preserving the known heterogeneous cellular architecture of the kidney including rare cell types 
- Meaningful conserved cellular marker genes and functions across all species consistent with the literature and expert opinions

While we also compared other integration tools, we learned that optimizing hyperparameters is as important as testing multiple integration tools.
